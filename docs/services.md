# Contributing Services to AlphaSwarm

## Overview

This guide will walk you through creating and contributing new services to the AlphaSwarm ecosystem.
For general contributing guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Service Architecture

Services in AlphaSwarm are built around the following core principles:

- 🎯 **Focused**: Dedicated to a specific domain or functionality
- 🔌 **Independent**: Minimally coupled with other services
- 📊 **Observable**: Providing logging and metrics for monitoring
- 🛡️ **Resilient**: Handling errors and recovery gracefully

Services are encouraged to encapsulate all the business logic for a specific feature or functionality. Tools, on the other hand, should act as **thin wrappers** that delegate their work to these underlying services. This separation of concerns ensures that your core logic remains centralized and reusable while keeping user interfaces simple and focused.

## Creating a New Service

### 1. Basic Structure

A new service should follow a clear and consistent structure. Before creating a new service category, ensure that none of the existing categories fits your new service. Your service code should reside under the appropriate category within the `alphaswarm/services/` directory. A typical directory structure might look like this:

```
alphaswarm/
├── services/
│   ├── service_category/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── my_custom_service.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests/
    ├── unit/
    │   └── services/
    │       └── service_category/
    │           └── test_my_custom_service.py
    └── integration/
        └── services/
            └── service_category/
                └── test_my_custom_service.py
```

Implement your service in `my_custom_service.py`:

- **Service Class**: Create a class that encapsulates the core functionality of your service.
- **Initialization**: Include setup and configuration in `__init__` method.
- **Core Methods**: Implement methods that perform the main operations.
- **Error Handling**: Provide robust error handling and logging.

### 2. Example

This could look as follows:

```python
class MyCustomService:
    """
    MyCustomService handles the processing of XYZ data and performs ABC operations.
    """

    def __init__(self, config: MyCustomServiceConfig):
        self.config = config
        # Initialize resources, connections, or other dependencies here

    def process(self, data: MyDataType) -> MyDataType:
        """
        Process the input data and return the result.
        
        Args:
            data: The input data to be processed.
        
        Returns:
            The result of processing the input data.
        """
        try:
            # Implement your service logic here
            result = data  # Replace with actual processing logic
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            # Log the error appropriately
            raise e
```
