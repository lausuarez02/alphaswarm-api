## How to file issues and get help

This project uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chain-ml/alphaswarm/issues)
to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

Additionally, we provide support on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/theoriq-dev). Feel free to ask questions, discuss code, and talk about feature ideas or improvements!
