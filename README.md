### Roadmap

- üåê Integration with Theoriq protocol to connect with growing ecosystem of agents and swarms providing trading strategies and signals

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
  - Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Verify installation with `python --version`
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (package manager)
  - Install Poetry with `pipx install poetry`
  - Verify installation with `poetry --version`
- Basic understanding of crypto trading concepts

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

First, ensure you have all prerequisites installed, including Python and poetry.

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chain-ml/alphaswarm.git
cd alphaswarm
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# For basic installation
poetry install

# For development (includes testing tools)
poetry install --with dev
```

Note: Poetry manages its own virtual environments, so a separate virtual environment should not be required. Refer to the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/) for more information.

### 2. API Keys Setup

Before running the framework, you'll need to obtain several API keys:

1. **LLM API Key**:

   - [Anthropic API Key](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started) if using Claude models (default)
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) if using GPT models
   - or any other LLM provider [supported by LiteLLM](https://models.litellm.ai/)

2. **Blockchain Access**:

   - [Alchemy API Key](https://www.alchemy.com/) (required for blockchain data)
   - RPC URLs from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or another RPC provider of choice

3. **Optional - Telegram Bot** (for notifications):
   - Create a bot through [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) with `/newbot` and securely save the bot token
   - To get chat ID, run `examples/telegram_bot.py` and message `/start` or `/id` to your bot

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Create your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the required variables in your `.env` file.

#### Required environment variables:

LLM Configuration (at least one required):

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key if using Claude models (default)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key if using GPT models
- For any other provider ensure to follow the same pattern

Blockchain Access:

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: Your Alchemy API key for accessing blockchain data

Ethereum Configuration (only if using Ethereum):

- `ETH_RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint URL for connecting to Ethereum network
- `ETH_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum wallet address for trading
- `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for your Ethereum wallet

Base Configuration (only if using Base):

- `BASE_RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint URL for connecting to Base network
- `BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Base wallet address for trading
- `BASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for your Base wallet

#### Optional configurations:

Testing environment variables:

- `ETH_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: Your Sepolia testnet RPC endpoint URL
- `ETH_SEPOLIA_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum wallet address for Sepolia testnet
- `ETH_SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for your Sepolia testnet wallet

Notification settings:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Required for sending alerts via Telegram bot
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Required chat ID for receiving Telegram alerts
- `TELEGRAM_SERVER_IP`: IP address for Telegram server (defaults to 0.0.0.0)
- `TELEGRAM_SERVER_PORT`: Port for Telegram server (defaults to 8000)

Logging configuration:

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets logging verbosity level (defaults to INFO)
- `LOG_FORMAT`: Custom format for log messages (default: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")

#### Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep private keys secure and start with testnets
- Use separate API keys for development and production
- Consider using key rotation for production deployments

### 4. Additional Configuration

The framework uses YAML configuration files to define trading venues, token pairs, and other application-specific and trading-related settings. The main configuration file is `config/default.yaml`.

Key configuration sections:

- **Network Environments**: Production and test network configurations
- **Trading Venues**: Supported DEXs with their supported pairs and settings for each chain
- **Chain Configuration**:
  - Chain-specific wallet and RPC settings
  - Token addresses and decimals
  - Gas settings and transaction parameters
- **Telegram**: Bot configuration for notifications

Note: Always verify contract addresses from official sources.

## Usage

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for more information about usage examples.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make all-tests

# Run specific test suites
make unit-tests
make integration-tests  # Requires API keys to be specified
```

### Code Quality

The project uses:

- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- ruff for linting
- mypy for type checking

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .

# Run linters
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run mypy .
```

or use Makefile shortcuts:

```bash
make dev-lint
```
